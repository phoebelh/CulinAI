# CulinAI - Spring 2024 Tech Treks
#### Leia Yun, Phoebe Huang, Ann Lee, Ryan Kawahara (Tutor)
## Overview
### Purpose
CulinAI is an AI-powered site that allows users to generate recipes by uploading a photo of their fridge or food items.

### Users
CulinAI is for those who:
- Want to try new recipes 
- Want to reduce food waste
-Don’t know what they can cook using the groceries that they already have

### Why?
We wanted to explore the idea of “cooking with nothing.”
CulinAI answers “What should I eat today?” without wasting or buying food.

### User Workflow
- Users upload ingredient photos via an easy-to-use homepage interface
- Uploaded images are analyzed by the LLaVa model to detect ingredients
- LLaVa uses detected ingredients to create and display recipes with Stable Diffusion-generated visuals

## Noteworthy files
We used this [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template project that's preconfigured to work with Replicate's API.

- [pages/index.js](pages/index.js) - The React frontend that renders the home page in the browser
- [pages/api/predictions/index.js](pages/api/predictions/index.js) - The backend API endpoint that calls Replicate's API to create a prediction
- [pages/api/predictions/[id].js](pages/api/predictions/[id].js) - The backend API endpoint that calls Replicate's API to get the prediction result

## Usage

Install dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

Add your [Replicate API token](https://replicate.com/account#token) to `.env.local`:

```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-token-here>
```

Run the development server:

```console
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.
